      <description>London, United Kingdom This was my first time being LIVE on tv. Thanks to Prof Ahmed for the invitation and Alam Uncle for arranging it. I&amp;rsquo;m by no means anyone of that stature. I&amp;rsquo;ve really received unprecedented respect from the Bengali community in the UK.
I took this opportunity to talk about the importance of girls in STEM.</description>
